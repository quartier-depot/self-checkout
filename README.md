### Recommended IDE Setup

## Deployment at Quartierdepot

Although there are other deployment options (like hosting on a Webserver),
we deploy the application directly to the POS device as an Ubuntu Snap application.

The Snap application runs an Express server internally and takes care of calls to the backend,
keeping the secrets save (they are not exposed to the browser and encrypted for backend communication)
and taking care of CORS (all calls from web application are routed through a proxy).

## Troubleshooting

* `sudo snap logs quartier-depot-self-checkout`
* `sudo journalctl -ef -u snap.quartier-depot-self-checkout.quartier-depot-self-checkout`
